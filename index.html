<p>Pack for any vacation, any trip, or anywhere else with Travel Checklist.
<br><br>
Have you ever wished that packing for vacation was less of a hassle? That's why we created Travel Checklist. It gives you packing reminders just in case you forget. It asks you what you need and don't need on your trip instead of having you tell it everything, so you'll never type a single letter. And for those items Travel Checklist can't guess, you can dictate then right from your Dashboard. So you'll never see a keyboard again when you're creating your list.
<br><br>
Travel Checklist wouldn't be Travel Checklist without Trips Catalogues. Trips Catalogues helps you pack for just about anywhere, not just vacations. So if you're going to the beach, you can pack for that. If you're going on a hike, you can pack for that. If you're going fishing in the middle of the ocean on a tiny one-person boat with a gigantic cooler that takes up three quarters of the space and a bathing suit, you can pack for that too.
<br><br>
Travel Checklist is free forever. You can download the app for free, access Trips Catalogues for free, add unlimited items to your list for free, and use every single feature in the whole entire app for free. No in-app purchases, no limits, just FREE!

<h2>Packing Suggestions</h2>
<p>It's not worth having a list if you forget to put something on it. That's why Travel Checklist has packing suggestions! When you're creating your list, Travel Checklist will show you some commonly packed vacation items, and you can simply tap them to add them to your list. So you'll never forget things like phone chargers and medication. Plus, your suggestions automatically adjust based on what you're doing on your trip. So if you tell Travel Checklist you're going swimming, it'll add swimsuits and towels to your list. And for the items that Travel Checklist can't think of (which is very few), you can dictate them directly to your list with the link on the Dasboard. We've taken typing out of list-making. You're welcome.</p>

<h2>Trips Catalogues</h2>
<p>Vacation's not the only thing we need to pack for! Trips Catalogues can help you pack for virtually any place, from a hike to a boating trip to the beach. With Trips Catalogues, you can browse the locations, then add the list to your Dashboard just like your vacation lists! And if you want to pack quickly, you can still view the list in the Trips Catalogues menu and check them off there without ever adding the list to your Dashbaord. It's convenience like you've never seen before.</p>
